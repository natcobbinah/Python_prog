In python, If you need to import a module from the standard library and a module
that you wrote, place the import statement for the standard library module
first. Then add a blank line and the import statement for the module you
wrote. In programs with multiple import statements, this convention makes
it easier to see where the different modules used in the program come from.

In python, Every method call associated with an instance automatically passes self, which is
a reference to the instance itself; it gives the individual instance access to
the attributes and methods in the class. 

In python, If you want a function to accept several different kinds of arguments, the
parameter that accepts an arbitrary number of arguments must be placed
last in the function definition. Python matches positional and keyword
arguments first and then collects any remaining arguments in the final
parameter.
